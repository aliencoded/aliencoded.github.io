<p>One of the challenges of getting started with jekyll is figuring out how to write content for your site.&nbsp; After doing a very quick search of what's actually available and what other jekyllers are using, I have decided to move forward with using a visual editor like <a href="wordtohtml.net" target="_blank">wordtohtml.net</a>. Familiarity with HTML leaves me the option to use other tools or templates to write content more simply.&nbsp; Also, if I find that I don't actually like using this pattern for writing content, the promise from jekyll is that it is easy to change.&nbsp; I have my fingers crossed.</p>
