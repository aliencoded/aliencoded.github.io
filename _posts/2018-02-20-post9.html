    <p>The window banged into my head and woke me up from my drifting
      sleep. The bus was slowing down for its next stop but the window
      sized potholes in the street were too much for the bus's old suspension
      system to smooth out.</p>
    <p>"53rd and Park," the bus operator called out over the tinny speaker
      system. An elderly woman covered in long trench coat slowly made her
      way to the front, thanked the driver and exited the bus. Once safely
      cleared, 3 noisy teenagers climbed aboard.</p>
    <p>"Yo, I'm telling you, that's what happened. Why won't you believe
      me man?" a lean boy with long black hair pleaded with his two
      friends. They both began to laugh as they took their seats on the
      bus.</p>
    <p>"You always tell the tallest tales! You're like a professional
      storyteller. You should go into showbiz. I'm sure you'll
      make millions" the taller boy retorted.</p>
    <p>"Dude, you are a bigger liar than Trump, heck, forget that, a bigger liar
      than Hillary!" a chubbier boy added. The long black haired boy shook
      his head with disbelief.</p>
    <p>"It's up to you if you don't believe me! Your loss!" he exclaimed.</p>
    <p>The bus started moving again and entered on to the highway. The
      next stop wouldn't happen for at least 15 minutes depending on highway
      traffic conditions. I looked out over the ramp and saw an endless
      stream of cars packed tightly. I sighed. It would be at least
      an hour before I would be able to make it home. This would be the
      3rd time this month that I had missed the early bus and settled for the 6
      o clock. I bundled up my hoodie and wedged it under my head between
      the window and the headrest. It was quite comfortable and
      warm. I could even fall asleep if the seats on the bus weren't so
      upright. </p>
    <p>As the bus began its stop-and-go journey through the 4 lane gridlock, I
      drifted asleep again to the sound of the bus's soft engine. My mind
      slipped back to my meeting from 5 weeks ago which had led me to be where I
      was now.</p>
