    <p>I can do it.&nbsp; I can write!&nbsp; I have so many great ideas to share
      and people will want to read what I write.&nbsp; That is what I told
      myself when I started to write for a blog.&nbsp; But when the time came to
      actually put ink on paper, or in this case type text between &lt;p&gt;s,
      the task was much more daunting, and doubt creeps in.&nbsp; Who would want
      to read what I write on this corner of the internet.&nbsp; There is a
      whole internet out there for people to read!&nbsp; Reddit, Wikipedia,
      Facebook, Twitter.&nbsp; Who has time for traditional blog reading
      nowadays anyway.&nbsp; It, especially, will not be people listening to
      podcasts or those endlessly watching cat videos on loop on YouTube(I think
      I already use that expression too much).&nbsp; But, alas, I must remind
      myself- the blog created here is not particularly meant to read to be
      consumed by a large unknown, uncaring, and usually quite critical,
      crowd.&nbsp; Rather, it is nothing more than an exercise in my creative
      ability in the hopes that it will leave me feeling fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But that cannot be the only goal that is achieved.&nbsp; If my ideas were
      to resonate with some reader, perhaps then they may nod their heads in
      agreement and perhaps lead to a certain sort of epiphany for them.&nbsp;
      In any case, this blog can hopefully function as a public journal to semi
      stream-of-consciousness sort of blabbering.&nbsp; There isn't even a spell
      check that I am using right now!</p>
