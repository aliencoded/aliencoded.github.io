    <p>Dell is going public again without holding an IPO. The arrangement to do
      so is a bit complex but has been summarized by experts as a share buyback
      of VMWare (of which Dell owns a majority stake in). The infograph by <a href="https://vizologi.com/business-strategy-canvas/dell-business-model-canvas/">Vizologi&nbsp;</a>
      shows most of Dell's revenue comes from its selling of support services
      and computing devices to consumer. </p>
    <p>This arrangement means non-corporate and general investors can now buy
      shares of the company on the New York stock exchange. As for consumer
      products, I would expect to see strong performance in consumer laptops,
      desktops, and tablets as demand for newer and more power efficient
      hardware increases. The Dell XPS series is an excellent and highly rated
      laptop series. The Alienware series is also very popular with gamers and
      the high end market, especially with lower cost effectiveness of
      performing custom builds(buying components on sale notwithstanding).
      VMWare, though a leader in the industry, may see some disruption from
      Citrix and Microsoft as they continue expanding their server
      virtualization services. </p>
    <p>All in all, although I expect Dell will continue to offer a decent
      product offering, its long term business viability depends on its ability
      to react efficiently to consumer demands. </p>
