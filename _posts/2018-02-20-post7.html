<p>Dell is going public again without holding an IPO.  The arrangement to do so is a bit complex but mostly seems to be through a share buyback of VMWare (which Dell owns a majority stake in).  The infograph by Vizologi (https://vizologi.com/business-strategy-canvas/dell-business-model-canvas/) – shows most of Dell’s revenue comes from its selling of support services and computing devices to consumer.  
</p>
<p>This arrangement means non-corporate and general investors can now buy shares of the company on the New York stock exchange.  As for consumer products, I would expect to see strong performance in consumer laptops, desktops, and tablets as demand for newer and more power efficient hardware increases.  The Dell XPS series is an excellent and highly rated laptop series.  The Alienware series is also very popular with gamers and the high end market, especially with lower cost effectiveness of doing custom builds.  VMWare, though a leader in the industry, may see some disruption from Citrix and Microsoft as they continue expanding their server virtualization services.  
</p>
<p>All in all, although I expect Dell will continue to offer a decent product offering, it’s long term business viability depends on its ability to react efficiently to consumer demands.
