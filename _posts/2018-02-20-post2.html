<p><strong>Gotchya #1<br /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Out of the box, the rendering engine (is it liquid?) will not render pages that are date stamped at a future time.&nbsp; Spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why my page wasnt generating.&nbsp; =(</p>
<p><strong>Gotchya #2<br /></strong></p>
<p>The date prepended in the post file name (yyyy-mm-dd-you-post-name) does not matter at all.&nbsp; In fact, the title also does not matter.&nbsp; The values in the "front matter" portion of the posts is what is used to determine if a post will be generated for the site.</p>
