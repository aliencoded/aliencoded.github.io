<p>How much ram do you really need? 8gb? 16gb? 64gb?&nbsp;</p>
<p>S<strong>hort answer</strong></p>
<p>As much as you can afford, because more is always better, and the additional power draw is negligable in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer-</strong></p>
<p>If you're shopping for a laptop, you are likely to see ads for laptops that have usually 8gb or 16b configurations.&nbsp; If price is no object, then it usually makes sense to buy a machine with as much ram as possible to 'future-proof' it as much as possible.&nbsp; However, quite often, the extra ram may not be useful if you don't actually use it for anything.&nbsp; For web browsing and watching cat videos on youtube 8gb, or even 4gb on a windows machine will be more than sufficient.&nbsp; Most smartphones that are released in 2018 actually tend to have less than 4gb of ram as well.&nbsp; One of the differences between phones and desktops is that phones are more aggressive at suspending, or terminating unused applications in the foreground.&nbsp; Usually the phones that tend to have more ram have more advanced capabilities to run applications in true multitasking containers.</p>
<p>Personally, I buy the largest sticks of ram possible that are accepted by my motherboard.&nbsp; I currently have 2x16gb of ram in my desktop.&nbsp; However, I have never come close to utilizing even half of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But of course, I have a habit of closing unused applications.&nbsp; At the time of writing, I am running a virtual box instance, and a chrome browser on a Windows 10 host machine.&nbsp; Task manager reports that chrome is using 2.3gb of ram, while the virtual box manager is using ~0.1gb.&nbsp; It seems that the usage by&nbsp; ubuntu virtual machine does not appear in windows Task Manager.&nbsp; This should be something that could need to be fixed or it might be a 'feature' of virtualbox. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
