I was recently in the market for a new mattress, and, like any normal
      person, I searched what was available online.&nbsp; As it turns out, (as
      of September 2018), there are a number of different online retailers
      peddling their wares.&nbsp; A google search today for "mattress" today
      revealed the following sponsored links in the following exact order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="saatvamattress.com">saatvamattress.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="nectarsleep.com/%3F">nectarsleep.com/&#8206;</a></li>
      <li><a href="amazon.com/mattresses%3F">amazon.com/mattresses&#8206;</a></li>
      <li><a href="bestmattressonline.org/reviews%3F">bestmattressonline.org/reviews&#8206;</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following are the next 5 unsponsored links, which means their rank in
      the search result is mostly driven by the weight given to them by google
      page rank algorithms.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="mattressfirm.com/">mattressfirm.com/</a></li>
      <li><a href="casper.com/mattresses/">casper.com/mattresses/</a></li>
      <li><a href="purple.com/mattresses">purple.com/mattresses</a></li>
      <li><a href="costco.com/mattresses.html">costco.com/mattresses.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="wayfair.com/bed-bath/cat/mattresses-c414871.html">wayfair.com/bed-bath/cat/mattresses-c414871.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/bedroom/Mattresses">ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/bedroom/Mattresses</a>/</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, my original search process for a mattress did not lead me to
      purchase the mattress with the highest precedence on search.&nbsp; Rather,
      my decision was more influenced by the numerous ads that began to appear
      on e-commerce and social media platforms. It was truly these ads that
      played a larger role in my decision making.&nbsp; User cookies play a
      larger role than one might originally imagine in world of
      e-commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After reading several articles and watching many review videos on
      youtube, I settled on the fairly well-known Leesa mattress.&nbsp; My end
      conclusion at the time of purchase is that most mattresses are about the
      same but Leesa does have a mission of caring and giving back to the
      community.&nbsp; If I were to pay a premium on a mattress, at least some
      of my cash would go towards helping someone who needed help getting
      appropriate bedding(or so my reasoning went). &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Alas, it turns out the mattress was not really worth the price tag that I
      paid for it, and my sleep did not improve noticeably.&nbsp; Hence, I made
      a call to the Leesa customer service after giving the new mattress a fair
      chance (studies and retailers say to give at least 30-60 days).&nbsp; By
      answering 2 short questions, and with a hold time of less than 2 minutes,
      a call time of less than 4 minutes,&nbsp; I was able to schedule a pick up
      for my mattress within the next 2 weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp; There was no
      pushback of any sorts by the customer representative, and this was
      refreshingly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I am thoroughly impressed by Leesa's customer service and would recommend
      anyone in the market for a new mattress to give them a chance if they are
      swayed by reviews and their own research.&nbsp; They are, so far, a
      company that can be trusted.&nbsp; I will update this post when the
      mattress has been picked up and my monies refunded.</p>
