<p>The window banged into my head and woke me up from my drifting sleep.&nbsp; The bus was slowing down for its next stop but the window sized potholes in the street were too much for the bus's old suspension system to smooth out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"53rd and Park," the bus operator called out over the tinny speaker system.&nbsp; An elderly woman covered in long trench coat slowly made her way to the front, thanked the driver and exited the bus.&nbsp; Once safely cleared, 3 noisy teenagers climbed aboard.</p>
<p>"Yo, I'm telling you, that's what happened.&nbsp; Why won't you believe me man?"&nbsp; a lean boy with long black hair pleaded with his two friends.&nbsp; They both began to laugh as they took their seats on the bus.</p>
<p>"You always tell the tallest tales!&nbsp; You're like a professional storyteller.&nbsp; You should go into showbiz.&nbsp; I'm sure you'll make millions" the taller boy retorted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dude, you are a bigger lier than Trump, heck, forget that, a bigger lier than Hillary!" a chubbier boy added.&nbsp; The long black haired boy shaked his head with disbelief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's up to you if you don't believe me!&nbsp; Your loss!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The bus started moving again and entered on to the highway.&nbsp; The next stop wouldn't happen for at least 15 minutes depeneding on highway traffic conditions.&nbsp; I looked out over the ramp and saw an endless stream of cars packed tightly.&nbsp; I sighed.&nbsp; It would be at least an hour before I would be able to make it home.&nbsp; This would be the 3rd time this month that I had missed the early bus and settled for the 6 o clock.&nbsp; I bundled up my hoodie and wedged it under my head between the window and the headrest.&nbsp; It was quite comfortable and warm.&nbsp; I could even fall asleep if the seats on the bus weren't so upright.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the bus begain its stop-and-go jounry through the 4 lane gridlock, I drifted asleep again to the sound of the bus's soft engine.&nbsp; My mind slipped back to my meeting from 5 weeks ago which had led me to be where I was now.&nbsp;</p>
