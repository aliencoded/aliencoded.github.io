    <p>I noted that the following sites are no longer being updated due to the
      current shutdown- </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.usa.gov/">https://www.usa.gov/</a> - innocuously
        named, but primarily provides information about the US government </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their full mission statement can be found <a href="https://www.usa.gov/history-of-website">here</a></p>
    <p>"We create and organize timely, needed government information and
      services and make them accessible to the public anytime, anywhere, via
      their channel of choice."</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">National Park Service</a> -
        availability of parks and protection of wildlife are probably one of the
        lower concerns </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, some websites are more equal than others and are operating
      normally.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/">https://www.irs.gov/</a> - tax
        collection </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.army.mil/">https://www.army.mil/</a> - military </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/</a>
        - propaganda </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.cia.gov/">https://www.cia.gov/</a> - intelligence
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>A full list of government sites is available here </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/%20">https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/
        </a></p>
    <p>It's quite astounding how many agencies are part of the federal
      government.&nbsp; This is probably why the federal budget(deficit) is so
      astounding.</p>
