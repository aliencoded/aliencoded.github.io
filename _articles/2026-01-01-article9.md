Officials note that the holiday is largely symbolic, intended to raise awareness of the importance of technology in everyday life while injecting levity into policy discussions.

The quirky observance has become an internet sensation, trending across social media platforms with hashtags like #AIAppreciationDay and #DigitalAssistantBreak.
