In a decisive administrative breakthrough widely described as “bold,” “historic,” and “astonishingly specific,” provincial authorities have announced a ban on makeup for female public employees, citing the urgent need to restore administrative seriousness to government offices.

Officials confirmed the move is part of a broader modernization effort designed to eliminate distractions such as colorful lipstick, visible eyeliner, and expressions of individuality occurring within a 20-foot radius of official paperwork.

“We are simply aligning external appearance with institutional efficiency,” one official explained while carefully adjusting a stack of documents that have not moved since 2014. “A neutral face promotes neutral governance.”

The directive reportedly aims to ensure that public servants present a “natural and disciplined” appearance — a phrase that analysts say has already generated 37 internal memos attempting to define what exactly qualifies as *natural*.

Local employees expressed mixed reactions.  
One administrative worker stated, “We assumed improving services would involve infrastructure or resources. It turns out it was blush.”

Another employee noted that the new policy has at least simplified morning routines: “Now my preparation time has been reduced to wondering what policy might regulate eyebrows next.”

Observers say the measure arrives amid ongoing economic challenges, infrastructure strain, and widespread administrative pressures — leading some analysts to praise the government for finally identifying a manageable problem.

Policy experts warn the initiative could trigger unintended consequences, including the emergence of an informal “cosmetics underground” operating through discreet handbag networks and suspiciously well-hydrated appearances.

Meanwhile, sources inside the provincial administration confirm that a follow-up directive is being considered to address what officials described as “excessively expressive hairstyles.”

Authorities maintain the policy reflects a commitment to professionalism, stability, and the timeless principle that if a system cannot be fixed, it can at least be color-corrected.

Further guidance is expected once the Department of Visual Compliance finalizes its forthcoming handbook: *Foundations of Foundational Presentation*.
