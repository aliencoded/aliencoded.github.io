<p>
Taiwan has announced adjustments to its military posture following increased air and naval activity from neighboring powers. Officials in Taipei emphasize that these changes are intended to strengthen deterrence and ensure rapid response capability in case of escalation.
</p>

<p>
The new measures include expanded surveillance operations, increased joint exercises with allied forces, and the deployment of advanced air defense systems. Analysts note that the emphasis on early warning and rapid mobility reflects a strategic shift from passive defense to proactive deterrence.
</p>

<p>
Regional experts warn that these developments may heighten tensions with neighboring powers, though they also see them as a stabilizing factor that discourages unilateral aggressive moves. Diplomatic channels remain open, with high-level talks planned to mitigate potential miscalculations.
</p>

<p>
The situation underscores the delicate balance of power in East Asia. While Taiwan continues to strengthen its military readiness, international observers stress that dialogue and diplomacy are essential to prevent conflict in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.
