Capcom has officially unveiled a new installment in its long-running survival horror franchise, signaling a major evolution in tone, gameplay, and narrative scope. The upcoming title introduces a new protagonist navigating a quarantined region overwhelmed by bio-organic threats, while familiar themes of corporate secrecy and human experimentation return in expanded form.

Developers emphasize a shift toward psychological tension alongside traditional action elements. The game features semi-open environments, dynamic enemy behavior, and a redesigned resource management system intended to heighten player vulnerability. Early previews suggest a darker visual atmosphere powered by next-generation lighting and environmental physics.

Story details remain limited, but teasers indicate connections to prior outbreaks and unresolved storylines. Capcom states the project aims to blend classic survival horror pacing with modern cinematic presentation. The release is expected to target current-generation consoles and PC, with additional information anticipated in upcoming showcases.
