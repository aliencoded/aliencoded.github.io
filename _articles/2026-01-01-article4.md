excerpt: "As Ethiopia, Eritrea, and neighboring states realign foreign partnerships, old rivalries and new trade corridors are reshaping East Africa’s geopolitical landscape."

<p>
In East Africa, the balance of regional power is shifting as countries like Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti negotiate new trade and military partnerships. Analysts point to increased involvement by Gulf states and China as driving forces behind these realignments. For decades, rivalries over borders, resources, and influence have shaped the region’s political landscape, but the current wave of alliances is unprecedented in scale and complexity.
</p>

<p>
Economic corridors connecting ports in Djibouti to inland Ethiopia are being strengthened with foreign investment, while military cooperation agreements are quietly expanding. Experts warn that these moves could either stabilize the region by fostering cooperation or escalate tension as competing powers assert influence. Diplomatic meetings have multiplied in the past few months, signaling both opportunity and risk for regional leaders.
</p>

<p>
Humanitarian considerations remain a critical concern. Displacement from past conflicts has strained neighboring countries’ resources, and new power dynamics could affect refugee flows and aid delivery. International organizations are closely monitoring developments, particularly as infrastructure projects intersect with contested territories.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the Horn of Africa stands at a crossroads. The decisions of both regional and international actors in the coming months will likely define the region’s trajectory for years to come.
