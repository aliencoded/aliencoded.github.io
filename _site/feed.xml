&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yo, I'm telling you, that's what happened.&amp;nbsp; Why won't you believe me man?&quot;&amp;nbsp; a lean boy with long black hair pleaded with his two friends.&amp;nbsp; They both began to laugh as they took their seats on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus started moving again and entered on to the highway.&amp;nbsp; The next stop wouldn't happen for at least 15 minutes depeneding on highway traffic conditions.&amp;nbsp; I looked out over the ramp and saw an endless stream of cars packed tightly.&amp;nbsp; I sighed.&amp;nbsp; It would be at least an hour before I would be able to make it home.&amp;nbsp; This would be the 3rd time this month that I had missed the early bus and settled for the 6 o clock.&amp;nbsp; I bundled up my hoodie and wedged it under my head between the window and the headrest.&amp;nbsp; It was quite comfortable and warm.&amp;nbsp; I could even fall asleep if the seats on the bus weren't so upright.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

What about a monstrous 128gb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as you can afford, because more is always better, and the additional power draw is negligable in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're shopping for a laptop, you are likely to see ads for laptops that have usually 8gb or 16b configurations.&amp;nbsp; If price is no object, then it usually makes sense to buy a machine with as much ram as possible to 'future-proof' it as much as possible.&amp;nbsp; However, quite often, the extra ram may not be useful if you don't actually use it for anything.&amp;nbsp; For web browsing and watching cat videos on youtube 8gb, or even 4gb on a windows machine will be more than sufficient.&amp;nbsp; Most smartphones that are released in 2018 actually tend to have less than 4gb of ram as well.&amp;nbsp; One of the differences between phones and desktops is that phones are more aggressive at suspending, or terminating unused applications in the foreground.&amp;nbsp; Usually the phones that tend to have more ram have more advanced capabilities to run applications in true multitasking containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I buy the largest sticks of ram possible that are accepted by my motherboard.&amp;nbsp; I currently have 2x16gb of ram in my desktop.&amp;nbsp; However, I have never come close to utilizing even half of it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But of course, I have a habit of closing unused applications.&amp;nbsp; At the time of writing, I am running a virtual box instance, and a chrome browser on a Windows 10 host machine.&amp;nbsp; Task manager reports that chrome is using 2.3gb of ram, while the virtual box manager is using ~0.1gb.&amp;nbsp; It seems that the usage by&amp;nbsp; ubuntu virtual machine does not appear in windows Task Manager.&amp;nbsp; This should be something that could need to be fixed or it might be a 'feature' of virtualbox. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of getting started with jekyll is figuring out how to write content for your site.&amp;nbsp; After doing a very quick search of what's actually available and what other jekyllers are using, I have decided to move forward with using a visual editor like &lt;a href=&quot;wordtohtml.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wordtohtml.net&lt;/a&gt;. Familiarity with HTML leaves me the option to use other tools or templates to write content more simply.&amp;nbsp; Also, if I find that I don't actually like using this pattern for writing content, the promise from jekyll is that it is easy to change.&amp;nbsp; I have my fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
